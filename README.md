# Research-Starter-Kit
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Star this repo if it's useful, I'll keep updating it if I know people are following it.

### What is this?
Basically, I wasted a lot of time trying to figure out shit before I could start my research. A lot of logistical issues, and some technical issues. While research related issues on IIIT-H are very well known and ***moderately*** well documented(like [this Ping! article](https://pingiiit.org/cracked-mia-visible-cracks-in-academia/)), I could never really find a lot of solutions. So this is my attempt at trying to make things ****slightly*** easier for anyone who's newly entering the research life at IIIT-H. This will cover **only technical** issues.

**DISCLAIMER**: I'm a CVIT boi so everything mentioned here is from my own experience. If you want to contribute regarding other labs (or even CVIT), please fork and make a pull request, I'll approve it (provided it's not too controversial since thisis publicly accessible. But feel free to DM me some ***masala*** anyway ðŸ˜›)

### How accurate is this?
Well, probably not very accurate. I haven't actually bothered to look up any of the things I've written here, so it's only as accurate as my mind thinks it is (which I don't think actually reflects reality). So use this at your own peril. But if you do find errors, please do suggest fixes by making pull requests.
